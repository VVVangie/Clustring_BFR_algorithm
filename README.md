# Clustring_BFR_algorithm
 Implementing the Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm to do clustering for more than 320000 points with 10 dimensions.
 The dataset is from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uh-q6JTLyAfTE4iOT0j0Z3CGnZ0Yg3DQ/view?usp=sharing
 
 Data points which are outliers are named or indexed as “-1”, others are named by the cluster labels.
